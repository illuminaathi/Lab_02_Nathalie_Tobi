## 2 Small Python Exercises

### 2.1 Lists

#### Create a list of numbers between 1 and 20

To create a list of numbers between 1 and 20, we call
the `range` constructor with the arguments `start=1`,`stop=21`.
We use the returned `range` Object as a parameter in the `list`
constructor.

```python
list1 = list(range(1, 21))
```

#### Create a list containing the squares of list1, using List Comprehension

The power operator in python is `**`. To calculate the squares for each item in our `list`,
we use a List Comprehension with `x ** 2` as an expression. Next and last in line is a `for`
clause. It is part of every List Comprehension, and we use it to iterate all `list1` items.
We assign the new `list` Object to `list2`.

```python
list2 = [x ** 2 for x in list1]
```

#### Create a list with only the even values in list1, using List Comprehension

In this List Comprehension, we use `y` as statement, as there is no need to
change the `list1` items. We use the same `for` clause as before and follow up
with an `if-statement`. It uses the modulo operator to determine if `y` is evenly
divisible by two. If this returns `True`, `list[y]` is included in the returned `list`.

```python
list3 = [y for y in list1 if y % 2 == 0]
```

### 2.2 Sorting

#### Create your own datatype

Our datatype is called `Person` and it's constructor takes parameters `Name`,`Age`.
To define our own `class`, we simply declare `class Person`.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

We define `__init__` to allow the construction of `Person` Objects with our own parameters. Every
new instance of `Person` that is created will call it during construction.

#### Make it sortable

We want to sort Persons by age, low to high. To make a datatype sortable with the `<` operator,
it needs to implement `__lt__`. `Fred < Frederike` calls `Fred.__lt__(Frederike)`. If Fred is
younger than Frederike, this should return `True`. To archive this, `__lt__` returns `Fred.age < Frederike.age`.

```python
class Person:
    # details omitted
    def __lt__(self, other):  # we sorted our persons depending on the age the person has
        return self.age < other.age
```

All we have to do to sort a `list` of `Person` Objects is to put them in a `list` and call the `sort()`method.

```python
a = Person('Anton', 18)
b = Person('Betina', 20)
c = Person('Chad', 30)
d = Person('Dolly', 21)
people = [a, b, c, d]
people.sort()
```

## 3 Lambdas and List Comprehensions Applied

### Use glob to generate the list of files in a directory.

To use `glob`, we need to `Ã¬mport glob` first. The other thing we need is a directory with some test files.
We want to simulate the detection of dublicates in the "Downloads" directory. We create the aforementioned
directory in our project root. Next, we create some `.txt` files. Some are empty, some contain the same content
and others have similar names but differing contents. We create a list of `globs`. All files in "Downloads" that
end with `.txt` are included in the list. We test this
by printing the `list` to the console.

```python
globs = glob.iglob("./Downloads/*.txt",
                   recursive=True)


#  prints all the file names
def print_globs():
    for globi in globs:
        print(globi)
```

#### Define Duplicate Files - how to you check if two files contain the same text?

Under normal circumstances, files have the same content if they produce the same md5 hash. Although unlikely in
our case, collisions can occur. This means that a file outputs the same hash but the content is not the same.
We `import hashlib` to gain access to to `hashlib.md5()`. Ifhis allows us to define a method that returns the
`hexdigest` of 

#### Sketch the algorithm to detect and document duplicate files in pseudo code

#### Create a data structure that supports detection and documentation of the duplicate files.



#### Implement the script completely.

### How do you test your script?

We test our script manually, meaning that we evaluate the printed output of `find_doublettes`, because a proper
test `setUp()` and `tearDown()` would have meant for one of us to allow writing and, in case of `tearDown()`,
removing files on our system. Not to say that this is something otherworldly - but we do make mistakes.
